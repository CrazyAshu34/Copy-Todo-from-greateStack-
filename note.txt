1) first we create a variable which is inputbox and assign id inputbox.
2) second we create another variable listContainer and asign the value of list-container.
3) next we create a function named addTask() and set a condition if user type nothing then (inputbox.value ==='') Give alert. write something.
4) next else{ we create an variable named li and create a element li} and we connect li variable to innerHTML and assign the first variable which is inputbox with .value to get the vale from user. so we are getting an 'text vale' and showing on display using new li.
5) next we append li to listContainer which is the second variable we created.
6) following that we create another variable wich is 'span' and we connect innerHTML to it and assing a value = '\u00d7'. and then we append span to li. and closed the else statement
7) after doing this we we assin an new value to the first variable which is input.value = ''; which means we assing new black variable;
8) and we put the another functin beneath the addtask fun  'saveData()' and we closed the function.
9) ok and then we put Evenet listener to second variable listContainer and inside event function we put if statement with (e.target.tagname === 'LI'){ and after that e.target.classList.toggle('checked'); 
and place saveData() functin again
} the we close the if 
10) then else if- (e.target.tagName === 'SPAN') and under the else if e.target.parentElement.remove(); and we again saveData() and we close the (else if) 
11)and after all we close the event function and put (false in the last)
